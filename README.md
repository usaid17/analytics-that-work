## 🚀 Featured Project

### [Global Developer Ecosystem Trends (IBM Capstone)](./04-IBM-Capstone-Dev-Trends)
*A comprehensive analysis of the global engineering workforce, identifying market standards and emerging technology trends.*

**The Challenge:** Synthesize complex survey data from Stack Overflow to predict future hiring needs and developer skill gaps.

**Key Accomplishments:**
* **Data Cleaning:** Engineered a custom Python pipeline to handle semi-structured data and remove 154 hidden duplicates using `ResponseId` logic.
* **Advanced Analysis:** Utilized **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** to impute missing AI adoption data and **IQR** methods to filter salary outliers.
* **Visualization:** Created an interactive dashboard in **IBM Cognos** to map global developer density and technology adoption rates.
* **Insight:** Identified a "Golden Triangle" of essential skills (JS, Python, SQL) and predicted the rise of TypeScript and Go as high-value future skills.

**Tech Stack:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn), IBM Cognos Analytics.
