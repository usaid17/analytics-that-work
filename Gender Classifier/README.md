# 🧠 Gender Classifier

> A beginner-level NLP project that predicts gender from names using simple text classification.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project uses a labeled dataset of names to build a basic gender classifier.  
The goal is to explore how machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) can be applied to real-world business tasks — like **targeted marketing** or **personalized customer experiences**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Learn the basics of **text preprocessing**
- Apply a **classification algorithm** (e.g., Naive Bayes or Logistic Regression)
- Evaluate model performance with simple metrics
- Reflect on practical use cases and limitations

---

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

- Python 🐍  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- NLTK (for basic text cleaning)

## 📊 What’s Inside

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `notebook.ipynb` | Full code with explanations, model training, and evaluation |
| `sample-output.png` *(optional)* | Shows the output of predictions or metrics |
| `names_dataset.csv` *(if included)* | Sample dataset (male/female labeled names) |

---

## 💡 Business Context

Gender prediction is used in:
- Personalized **product recommendations**
- **Name disambiguation** in messy datasets
- **Customer segmentation** for marketing or surveys

⚠️ **Disclaimer:** Gender classification from names can be inaccurate and biased. It's important to consider ethical implications, especially in sensitive or identity-driven contexts.
